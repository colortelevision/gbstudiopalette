2 Scripts to automate the conversion of greyscale 'image.png' to the green palette recognized by GB STUDIO


>00. SETUP:

Navigate to folder in terminal.

Ensure you have Python3 installed.
RUN:

	python3 -V

If you don't have a version of python3 installed,
RUN: 

	brew install python3

If you don't have brew installed... go to 
	
	https://brew.sh
		
Follow the instructions, and try again.

Once Python3 is installed, we can ensure PIP's version,
RUN:

	python3 -m pip -V

Then we need to install NUMPY

	pip install numpy


>01. INSTRUCTIONS:

Let's generate the custom_palette.png file
RUN:

	python3 custom.py

Now, we'll convert 'image.png' from greyscale 
to the green palette recognized in GB-STUDIO,

	python3 convert.py

Pretty dope, huh?
